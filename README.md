## MITRE ATT&CK App for Splunk&reg;

#### Documentation
Detailed documentation can be found at: https://seynur.github.io/mitre-attack-app-for-splunk-docs

#### Overview
This application provides compliance and triage dashboards for MITRE ATT&CK Framework with drill-down capabilities. It is recommended to utilize Splunk Enterprise Security(https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/263/) and Splunk ES Content Update (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3449/).

#### Required Splunk Apps:
- [Splunk Enterprise Security](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/263/) 5.2 or above
- [Sankey Diagram - Custom Visualization](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3112/)

#### Recommended Splunk Apps:
- [Splunk ES Content Update](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3449/)
- [Splunk Common Information Model (CIM)](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1621/)
- [Lookup File Editor](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724/)

__Note__: Although the app will work without ES Content Update, it is highly recommended since it comes with many correlation rules that have mitre_attack annotations already.

#### Setup Instructions
After installation of the application you will be on Setup page.  Review your desired configuration for scheduled searches and simply hit Save to continue.  Default view will be the Compliance Dashboard.  If the matrix is not populated, click on the table to run manually, which will direct you to the Lookup Generation dashboard (searches run automatically on that dashboard).

__Note__: If using the legacy Alert Manager app, you will need to uncheck ```Use Enterprise Security App``` checkbox within __Setup__ view.

#### Saved Searches
This application comes with predefined saved searches.  Lookup Gen searches are scheduled to run  daily after midnight.  The main ones that are used by views:
- ```MITRE ATT&CK All Rules and Techniques Lookup Gen```: This lookup generator checks currently enabled correlation rules via analytic stories and combines the searches with user-defined mitre_user_rule_technique_lookup.csv file that matches MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs with rules.
- ```MITRE ATT&CK Compliance Lookup Gen```: This lookup generator relies on mitre_all_rule_technique_lookup.csv in order to generate a new lookup to properly display MITRE ATT&CK Compliance martix.
